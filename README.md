# News Breakers
Troy Hurst - Tommy Ngo - Boi-Hien Huang - Darrien Gunn - Steven Joseph

## Overview
For our project, we used Unity Game Engine to create a 2D side scrolling platformer. The game includes mechanics such as jumping, running, and being able to attack various enemies. The game has multiple obstacles and is called News Breakers.
The printing press has printed 3 big bosses that have assumed the shape of various fonts. Your character traverses through multiple hazardous areas and utilizes armor upgrades that the bosses drop. You will attempt to defeat all 3 bosses and break news to the world that evil has been defeated. 

## Levels
The game is broken down into 3 levels. In order to reach the early game bosses, our hero must traverse the obstacles of the stage until the final boss is met. Once the protagonist defeats the stage boss, he can equip the boss's unique item and use it to venture forth on his journey. 

Level 1: Times New Roman

## Characters

* Journalist - The main protagonist was created by the printing press that comes from the mage's childhood stories from his mother. Meant to be a savior who defends the world in his mothers tales.
* Font Monsters - Font monsters are fonts that were created by the printing press based off of the Mage’s old fonts. These fonts attack the hero by shooting letters at them. The fonts have special items that the hero needs to defeat the printing press, so when they die they drop the items.
* Printing Press - The printing press is a magical machine that was created by the mage and has gone rampant and is printing twisted versions of fonts previously made using this press. 

## Gameplay
The player is controlled using either WASD or the arrow keys to move around the map. On a 2D plane, the character can platform around using space to jump, and can jump 3 times per landing on the ground. Around the map are obstacles in the form of letters and spikes that must be evaded. Spikes can not be beaten, and will instantly restart the level unless you lose all your lives, which restarts the game or sends you to the home screen. Enemies can be attacked using the M key, which makes the player attack nearby enemies for a set amount of dmg. In each level as well as platforms and obstacles, there is a boss, one that shoots out letters from its body at the player, and comes towards the player. It is the player's job to evade the incoming letters and the boss to land as many attacks as it can, eventually defeating the boss. As the player defeats the boss, they gain the ability to go to the next stage, as well as an upgrade to the player character that will help them fight. Each level's enemies and bosses are based around a type of font. Level 1 is Times New Roman, level 2 is Danger font, and level 3 is "The Boss" (in traditional Chinese.)

## Completed Tasks
* Hero design - A character is designed to match the plot of the game
* Player Movement and Combat - The player can move and attack enemies and there are animations for both combat and movement
* Score Counter - The player gains score whenever they defeat an enemy or a boss
* Health and Life system - The player has health and a certain amount of lives 
* Loading Screen - There is a loading screen for each transition to a new level
* Main Menu - There is a main menu that starts the game and allows changing volume
* Equipment - After defeating a boss the player can pick up new equipment
* Obstacles - Each level has small enemies, platforms, and little obstacles that the player needs to overcome
* First Stage - There is a first level that has Times New Roman as the main design along with platforms and other obstacles
* Second Stage - There is a second stage where the Danger Font is the design and has an elevator as a main design point
* Third Stage - There is a final stage where the enemies are Chinese characters and certain items are needed to progress through the level (keys)
* Enemies and Bosses - Each of the levels has different enemies and different bosses at the end
* Losing - The player can lose the game after depleting all of their lives
* Checkpoints - There are checkpoints when the player reaches a new level which will take them back to a certain point rather than starting over
* Attack and Jump Sounds - There are attack and jump sounds so that the player knows when they made an input
* Music - There is music for each stage of the game and is originally designed to fit the theme of the game

## Uncompleted Tasks
* Power Ups - The player could capture a power up to either: shoot, cast spells, or teleport. Became too difficult as animations would need to be created for each power up.
* Level 4/Print Press Boss - The final boss of the printing press was supposed to be implemented in level 4, but that was a stretch early on that underestimated the amount of work we already had to do.
* Bug Free - With any game, even ones that are developed over many years, there will always be bugs. This task was more of a loose goal that everyone was working on simultaneously, but of course we can’t catch them all.
* Health Regeneration: Was not necessarily an uncompleted task but definitely a task we wanted to implement towards the end of the game.
